# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator ☕

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Simulator! This program emulates the functionality of a real-world coffee machine, allowing users to select a coffee type, insert coins, and enjoy their brew. 🎉

## 🌟 Features

1. **Three Delightful Brews**: Choose from Espresso, Latte, or Cappuccino. 🍵
2. **Resource Check**: The machine ensures there's enough water, milk, and coffee before brewing. 💧🥛🌰
3. **Coin Wizard**: Accepts quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies and magically calculates your total. 💰
4. **Change Fairy**: Overpaid? Don't worry, you'll get your change back! 💸
5. **Resource Oracle**: Curious minds can request a report to peek into the machine's soul (or its current resources). 📊

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NandishRana/pong-game.git
   cd coffe-machine-program
   ```

2. **Run Game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. The machine will politely ask: "What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): ".
2. Speak your heart out! Want coffee? Say its name. Need a report? Whisper "report".
3. Coffee it is? You'll then dance the coin dance, inserting your treasured coins as prompted.
4. If the stars align (and you've put in enough coins), your brew will be handed to you, with any extra change.
5. To bid the machine farewell, simply say "off" when asked for your coffee choice.

## 📘 Behind the Scenes

The machine's brain consists of:
1. `MENU`: A spellbook that lists out the magical ingredients and cost for each brew.
2. `resources`: A treasure chest that keeps track of water, milk, and coffee reserves.

🌈 **Enjoy your magical coffee experience!** 🌈
